Small game in pygame as my submission for the final project of the Python MOOC of the University of Helsinki.
We were allowed to use only up to 4 sprites (the .png files). 
The game requires the pygame library to run.
The .png files are not my own.

In the game the player plays as a robot that journeys between levels. The player collects coins, avoids enemies and tries to fullfill quests for other robots to make friends. A level may have some unique special rule.
